Caribou is a [Grasshopper plugin](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/) for parsing downloaded Open Street Map data into Rhino geometry. Caribou is currently in an beta state, but core functionality should be stable.

### Installation

Caribou is available to download via the [Rhino Package Manager](https://www.rhino3d.com/features/package-manager/) (search *"Caribou"*) or on [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/caribou?lang=en).

### Documentation & Support

Caribou's documentation [lives on this website](https://caribou.philipbelesky.com) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/philipbelesky).

Support can be requested, or feedback provided, by [opening a discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/philipbelesky/Caribou/discussions). Issues and pull-requests are encouraged.

### Features

- âœ… Windows and MacOS are both fully supported
- âœ… Very fast parsing of even very large files
- âœ… Data-rich GUI interface provided for understanding and filtering OSM metadata
- âœ… Parsing is performed asynchronously so Grasshopper remains responsive
- âœ… Parse multiple OSM files simultaneously with de-duplication of geometry
- âœ… Allows for querying for arbitrary data outside of the primary OSM features/sub-features taxonomy
- âœ… Outputs are tree-formatted and organised per data-type to allow for downstream filtering, tagging, baking, etc

### Roadmap

- ðŸ•˜ Further speed optimisations
- ðŸ•˜ Component to help construct queries for arbitrary metadata
- ðŸ•˜ Parsing of `<relation>` type data
- ðŸ•˜ Integration with Rhino's `EarthAnchorPoint`
- ðŸ•˜ Customisable projection methods
